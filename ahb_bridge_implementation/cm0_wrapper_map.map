      Number using O6 output only:           2,751
      Number using O5 output only:              89
      Number using O5 and O6:                  274
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  15,616    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      8
      Number with same-slice register load:      5
      Number with same-slice carry load:         3
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 1,118 out of  15,822    7%
  Nummber of MUXCYs used:                      156 out of  31,644    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        3,264
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         2,434 out of   3,264   74%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 142 out of   3,264    4%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         688 out of   3,264   21%
    Number of unique control sets:              39
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             111 out of 126,576    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
